Current status - 
cloud watch and lambda integration is complete. The autoscaling up and down are working
 How to run - Change the ami id in the parameter store and it will trigger cw automatically
 Changing the ami triggers the cw alarm that triggers the update ami lambda with detail-type - parameter updated. Then a launch configuration is copied from the old instances and the new ami is used for it
This new launch config is used to update the asg and desired capacity is changed to 2n+1
This upscaling triggers the second cw alarm for each new instance created. So if we have 3 new instances, the alarm is triggered 3 times
Cw will trigger the lambda with detail type Instance created successfully and lambda will change the desired capacity to n-1
Ultimately the fault tolerant instances will be terminated and the desired capacity will return to (n-1)/2
 Eg. If we started at 3 instances, during upscaling the desired capacity changes to 2n + 1 which is 7. Because 4 new instances will be created, the second alarm will be triggered 4 times and all 4 instances will be ultimately terminated, desired capacity now comes back again to 3
