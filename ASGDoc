Description

The solution implements an automated updation of AMI on all instances in an Auto Scaling Group using Cloudwatch Alarms and Python Boto3 packages.

Architecture

Approach

The new ami is updated in Parameter Store which is tracked using a cloudwatch alarm. The cloud watch alarm triggers a lambda function which creates a new launch configuration using the AMI and updates the autoscaling group with it. The desired capacity of the ASG is updated to (n*2)+1 to accommodate fault tolerant instances. Another cloud watch alarm tracks the newly created instances. As soon as the instances are healthy, the alarm is triggered (n-1)/2 times and each time 1 fault tolerant instances is decommissioned from the ASG.
